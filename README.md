# Scalable Gaussian Process Regression

## Overview
This project explores scalable methods for **Gaussian Process Regression (GP)** to handle large datasets. Traditional GP regression, while powerful for uncertainty-aware predictions, suffers from **O(nÂ³) computational complexity**, making it impractical for big data applications.  

We evaluate approximation techniques such as:  
- **Sparse Gaussian Processes (Sparse GP)**  
- **Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI)**  
- **Local Approximate Gaussian Processes (laGP)**  

These methods aim to **improve efficiency while preserving prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification**.  

## Key Contributions
- **Mathematical foundations** of GP regression and its computational challenges  
- **Evaluation of scalable GP approximations** through theoretical analysis and empirical comparisons  
- **Benchmarking experiments** on synthetic and real-world datasets  
- **Recommendations** for selecting the best method based on dataset size, accuracy, and computational constraints  

## Technologies Used
- **Python (GPflow, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)**
- **R (laGP library)**
- **Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization**
